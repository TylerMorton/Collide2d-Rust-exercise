# Collision2d Rust Exercise

I decided to try out what all the hype was about and spent a few days learning Rust over spring break. I then decided to do a project that would bring me out of my comfort zone by working on a graphical simulation with no graphics or simulation programming background, while also reinforcing some the basic concepts of rust.

## How to run

1. Simply clone the repo.
`$: git clone https://github.com/TylerMorton/Collide2d-Rust-exercise.git`
2. Go into the collision2d directory
`$: cd Collide2d-Rust-exercise`
3. and run the project.
`$: cargo run`

## How to test
Repeat steps 1 & 2 above. Then run the code as such:
`$: cargo test`
